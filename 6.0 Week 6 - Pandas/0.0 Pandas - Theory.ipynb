    "Pandas is a popular open-source data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for handling structured data. Pandas is widely used for tasks such as data cleaning, preparation, and analysis. Its primary data structures are Series (one-dimensional labeled array) and DataFrame (two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types). These structures make it easy to work with tabular data, time series, and more. Pandas is a powerful tool for data wrangling and manipulation, and it's often used in conjunction with other libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.\n",
