So, the choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand.\n",

To address this limitation, developers introduced a new data type called ndarray, written in C for efficiency. To seamlessly integrate this powerful data type with Python, a wrapper was created, laying the foundation for what we now know as NumPy. This move significantly enhanced Python's capability for handling large datasets and performing complex numerical computations."
